# R Shiny visualising meteorological data

This project was developed for the R-programming course, part of my MSc in Data Analytics at the University of Glasgow in 2022.\
The purpose of the project is to create a R-shiny app which visualises meteorological data collected at several locations across the United Kingdom from 1st January 2020 to 30th November 2022. The data has been obtained from https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/220a65615218d5c9cc9e4785a3234bd0. Aside visualisations, the project calculates and
reports a diagnostic called the Hutton Criteria used to alert farmers of the risk of potato blight forming on potato crops.
